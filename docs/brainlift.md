This document serves as a log for the game development project. It will be updated regularly to track progress, learnings, and challenges.

## Learning Tools and Resources
*This section will document the tools, tutorials, documentation, and other resources used throughout the project.*

- **Primary AI Assistant:** Gemini 2.5 Pro (via Cursor)
- **Game Asset Library:** Elements Envato (recommended)
- ...

## Learning Pathway Decisions and Pivots
*This section will capture the rationale behind technology choices and any changes in direction during the project.*

- **Initial Decision (2024-07-29):** After analyzing the multiplayer life-simulation game concept, we have chosen to proceed with **Path 1: Godot and GDScript**.
    - **Rationale:** This stack was selected as the optimal choice for a first-time game developer aiming to build a systems-driven RPG.
    - **Comparison:**
        - **Unity (Path 3)** was considered powerful but with a learning curve that was too steep, potentially hindering the project's "Learning Velocity" goal.
        - **Browser-Based (Path 2)** was deemed too low-level, requiring extensive work on engine fundamentals (UI, state management, scene transitions) before core gameplay could be developed.
        - **Godot (Path 1)** offers the best balance. It's a full-featured engine that is beginner-friendly, has an intuitive architecture for the proposed game structure, and includes integrated networking support, which will be critical for the multiplayer requirement.
    - **Strategic Choice:** We will start with a 2D perspective (top-down or isometric) to reduce complexity and focus on implementing the core gameplay loop and stat-based mechanics quickly.
