### Path 2: Browser-Based Game
- **Framework:** Phaser 3 (2D) or Three.js (3D)
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Networking:** Socket.io for real-time multiplayer
- **Pros:** Both frameworks have extensive documentation. Phaser 3 is perfect for 2D games with built-in physics and animations. Three.js opens up 3D possibilities. Socket.io simplifies multiplayer implementation.

### Path 3: Unity for Cross-Platform
- **Engine:** Unity
- **Language:** C#
- **Networking:** Unity Netcode for GameObjects or Mirror Networking
- **Platform:** Desktop or WebGL build
- **Pros:** Unity has the largest game development community, countless tutorials, and comprehensive documentation. C# is well-structured and extensively covered by AI training data.

## Project Plan
1.  **Choose Technology:** Analyze game requirements against available technologies, compare pros/cons of different tech stacks, and make an informed decision based on project constraints.
2.  **Learning Path:** Generate a customized curriculum for the chosen stack, focusing on essential concepts needed for the game, and build small proof-of-concept demos to validate understanding.
3.  **Architecture:** Design the game architecture, plan the networking infrastructure for multiplayer support, and identify potential performance bottlenecks early.
4.  **Single-Player Mechanics:** Start with single-player mechanics, debug and optimize unfamiliar code patterns, and implement the core gameplay loop.
5.  **Multiplayer Integration:** Add the networking layer, implement state synchronization, and handle player connections/disconnections.
6.  **Performance Optimization:** Profile and identify bottlenecks, use AI to suggest optimization strategies, and ensure smooth gameplay with multiple concurrent players.
7.  **Polish and Test:** Add progression systems or storyline elements, implement UI/UX improvements, and balance game mechanics. Test with maximum expected concurrent players, verify low-latency performance, and fix any remaining bugs.
8.  **Documentation and Deployment:** Create setup and deployment instructions, document the learning process and AI utilization, and prepare demonstration materials.
