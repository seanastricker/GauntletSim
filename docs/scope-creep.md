# Scope Creep Ideas

## Player Interaction
- players have a special skill that gives other players boosts
- players can interact with other players, cool down
- players can add each other on X when interacting
- players can add NPCs on X

## Speech Bubbles
- Pokemon style (in a box below the actual screen)

## Austen Tweets
- cycles through a predetermined list of tweets

## Timed Events
- bathroom breaks
- MVP submissions
- ...

## Health animation
- if Health is 0, display "hurt" animation

## Levels of Winning
- if you have higher social/CCAT score, your job offer is more than $200k (based on some scale)

## Player appearance
- removing smoothing effect for better graphics

## Restarting New Game
- failed to host
- Kept Matt from previous game

## Music
- different music for different places

## GameEndWindow UI
- include all players in this from the start and have it set to "currently active" or something and update to "Kicked out" if they get kicked out
- include total number of players and reduce count when people are kicked out (pile of bones reference?)
